# Data Characteristics and Interrater Agreement

This repository contains the R code to accompany the article, *The Influence of Data Characteristics on Interrater Agreement Among Visual Analysts* by Katie Wolfe and Michael A. Seaman from the Department of Educational Studies at the University of South Carolina.

## Abstract

Visual analysis is the primary method of analyzing single-case research data, yet relatively little is known about the variables that influence ratersâ€™ decisions and rater agreement. Previous research has suggested that trend, variability, and autocorrelation may negatively impact interrater agreement, but studies have been limited by small numbers of graphs and participants whose knowledge of single-case research was not described. The purpose of this study was to examine the main and interaction effects of two levels of each of six data characteristics (e.g., level, trend, number of data points) on agreement among visual analysts. Using data from Lanovaz and Hranchuk (2021), we examined odds ratios to identify data characteristics that influence interrater agreement. Results suggest that trend and effect size, and to a lesser extent variability, have the largest impacts on interrater agreement. We discuss implications of our results for future research on improving interrater agreement among visual analysts.

## Current Repository Status

This repository was populated on 6 February 2023. There is a *Data* folder with two CSV files that are required to run the analyses. There is a *Functions* folder with two functions that are sourced into the analyses. The *Analysis* folder contains the three main R Notebook files, one for each of the three main questions investigated in the study. All results were produced using R scripts and code chunks while running R version 4.2.2, *Innocent and Trusting*, with RStudio version 2022.12.0.
